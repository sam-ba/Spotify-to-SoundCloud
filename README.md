# Spotify-to-SoundCloud

## Project Goal
I am a hobbyist DJ planning to release my mixes on digital streaming platforms (DSPs) like SoundCloud, YouTube, etc. The problem I face is that my daily DSP is Spotify. I currently have over 80 curated playlists in Spotify that I would like to port to SoundCloud. I am specific about SoundCloud as this is the DSP supported my mixing software, Rekordbox by Pioneer DJ. 
Automatically synced and updated playlists will reduce the overhead of making mixes by 3 hours for each mix session. This way I can focus on my transitions and editing the mixes to be posted online. 

## Given
I currently have Spotify Premium and SoundCloud Go. 

## To Run this Program
I hid my Client ID and Client Secret but those can be gotten from developer.spotify.com\
